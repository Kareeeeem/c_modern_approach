1. Give the decimal value.
    a. 077 = 63
    b. 0x77 = 119
    c. 0xABC = 1583

2. Which ones aren't legal? And classify the rest as integer or floating point.
    a. 010E2 (X)
    b. 32.1E+5 Floating point
    c. 0790 Integer
    d. 100_000 (X)
    e. 3.978e-2 Floating point

3. Which ones aren't legal?
    a. short unsigned int
    b. short float (X)
    c. long double
    d. unsigned long

4. If x is a variable of type char, which one of the following statements is
illegal?
    a. i += c;
    b. c = 2 * c - 1;
    c. putchar(c);
    d. printf(c); (X)

5. Which one is not a legal way to write 65?
    a. 'A'
    b. 0b1000001
    c. 0101
    d. 0x41

6. Which of char, short, int or long is the smallest to guatanteed to be large
enough to store the items of data?
    assuming 16bit
    a. Days in month = char
    b. Days in year = short
    c. Minutes in day = short
    d. Seconds in day = long

7. For each of these whats the equivalent octal escape?
    a. \b = \10
    b. \n = \12
    c. \r = \15
    d. \t = \11

8. For each of these whats the equivalent hex escape?
    a. \b = \0x08
    b. \n = \0x0A
    c. \r = \0x0D
    d. \t = \0x09

9. Suppose that i and j are variables of type int.
What is the type of the expression i / j + 'a'?
    int

10. int i; long j; unsigned int k; i + (int) j * k?
    unsigned int

11. int i; float f; double d; i * f / d?
    double

12. int i; float f; double d; d = i + f
    double

13. char c     = '\1';
    short s    = 2;
    int i      = -3;
    long m     = 5;
    float f    = 6.5;
    double d   = 7.5;

    a. c * i   = -3
    b. s + m   = 8.5
    c. f / c   = 6.500000
    d. d / s   = 3.750000
    e. f - d   = -1.00000
    f. (int) f = 6

14. Does the dollowing statement always compute the fractional part of f
correctly (assuming that f and frac_part are floats)? frac_part = f - (int) f;
    If the float value is outside of the range of an int the result of the
    conversion is meaningless or worse.

15. Define types Int8 Int16 and Int32 so they rep 8 16 and 32 bit ints on my
computer.
    typedef signed char Int8;
    typedef short int Int16;
    typedef int Int32;
