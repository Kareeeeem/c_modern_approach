1. Why is `sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0])` superior to `sizeof(a) / sizeof(t)`.
    You might end up changing the type of array elements, the first
    technique covers that. The second requires another code edit.

2. Describe how to use a digit as an array subscript.
    char i = '4';
    array[i-'0'];

3. Declare an array names weekend containing seven bool values, first
   and last should be true.
    bool weekend[7] = {[0] = true, [6] = true};

4. Use designated initializers in 3.
    Oops, already did.

8. An array for a month of hourly temperature readings.
